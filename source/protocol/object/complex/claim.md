A claim is a [[complex-object]] that contains a predicate that can be asserted about an [[object]], which requires input from an [[agent]] in order to be verified.  

Verifying claims often requires subjective evalation from an agent, as opposed to proofs, whose criteria are objectively satisfied or not.
