A context is a [[complex-object]] that contains:
1. a set of [[interpretation]]s associated with [[value]]s.
2. a set of [[ledger]]s bijectively mapped to this set of interpretations.
3. a reference to one or more parent contexts, whose [[part]]s (i.e. value mappings and ledger states) are inherited.
