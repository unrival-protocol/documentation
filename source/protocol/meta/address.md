An address is a string that unambiguously describes what it refers to.  

An address is only meaningful in the context of a [[protocol]], which specifies how the address should be interpreted.  This is true not just of Unrival addresses, but of any addresses.  For instance, an [[IP-address]] tells a router where a resource can be found, but since there is no guarantee that the data eventually found there is the data expected, it does not qualify as an [[unrival]] address.  Similarly, postal addresses only make sense given a system of interpretation.
